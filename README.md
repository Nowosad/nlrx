The nlrx package provides tools to setup NetLogo simulations in R. It
uses a similar structure as NetLogos Behavior Space but offers more
flexibility and additional tools for running sensitivity analyses.

## Installation

You can install the released version of nlrx from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nlrx")
#> Installing package into '/home/marco/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5'
#> (as 'lib' is unspecified)
#> Warning in install.packages :
#>   package 'nlrx' is not available (for R version 3.5.1)
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nldoc/nlrx")
```

## Example

The nlrx package uses S4 classes to store basic information on NetLogo,
the model experiment and the simulation design. Experiment and
simulation design class objects are stored within the nl class object.
This allows to have a complete simulation setup within one single R
object.

The following steps guide you trough the process on how to setup, run
and analyze NetLogo model simulations with nlrx

#### Step 1: Create a nl object:

The nl object holds all information on the NetLogo version, a path to
the NetLogo directory with the defined version, a path to the model
file, and the desired memory for the java virtual machine.

``` r
nl <- nl(nlversion = "6.0.3",
         nlpath = "C:/Program Files/NetLogo 6.0.3/",
         modelpath = "C:/Program Files/NetLogo 6.0.3/app/models/Sample Models/Biology/Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo",
         jvmmem = 1024)
```

#### Step 2: Attach an experiment

The experiment object is organized in a similar fashion as NetLogo
BehaviorSpace experiments. It holds information on model variables,
constants, metrics, runtime, â€¦

``` r
nl@@experiment <- experiment(expname="wolf-sheep",
                             outpath="C:/out/",
                             repetition=1,
                             tickmetrics="true",
                             idsetup="setup",
                             idgo="go",
                             idfinal=NA_character_,
                             runtime=50,
                             evalticks=seq(40,50),
                             metrics=c("count sheep", "count wolves", "count patches with [pcolor = green]"),
                             variables = list('initial-number-sheep' = list(min=50, max=150, step=10, qfun="qunif"),
                                              'initial-number-wolves' = list(min=50, max=150, step=10, qfun="qunif")),
                             constants = list("model-version" = "\"sheep-wolves-grass\"",
                                              "grass-regrowth-time" = 30,
                                              "sheep-gain-from-food" = 4,
                                              "wolf-gain-from-food" = 20,
                                              "sheep-reproduce" = 4,
                                              "wolf-reproduce" = 5,
                                              "show-energy?" = "false"))
```

#### Step 3: Attach a simulation design

While the experiment defines the variables and specifications of the
model, the simulation design creates a parameter input table based on
these model specifications and the chosen simulation design method. nlrx
provides a bunch of different simulation designs, such as
full-factorial, latin-hypercube, sobol, morris and eFast. A simulation
design is attached to a nl object by using on of these simdesign
functions:

``` r
nl@simdesign <- simdesign_sobol(nl=nl,
                                samples=500,
                                sobolorder=2,
                                sobolnboot=50,
                                sobolconf=0.95,
                                nseeds=2,
                                precision=3)
```

#### Step 4: Run simulations

All information that is needed to run the simulations is now stored
within the nl object. The run\_nl function allows to run one specific
simulation from the siminput parameter table. However, the most
efficient way to run all simulations at once is nesting the call of
run\_nl into a future\_map function. This loops over all defined
random-seeds and all rows of the siminput parameter table and reports
the results in a tibble.

``` r
library(furrr)
future::plan(multisession)

results %<-% furrr::future_map_dfr(getsim(nl, "simseeds"), function(seed){
  furrr::future_map_dfr(seq_len(nrow(getsim(nl, "siminput"))), function(siminputrow) {
    run_nl(nl = nl,
           seed = seed,
           siminputrow = siminputrow,
           cleanup = "all")
     })
   })
```

#### Step 5: Attach results to nl and run analysis

nlrx provides method specific analysis functions for each simulation
design. Depending on the chosen design, the function reports a tibble
with aggregated results or sensitivity indices. In order to run the
analyze\_nl function, the simulation output has to be attached to the nl
object first. After attaching the simulation results, these can also be
written to the defined outpath of the experiment object.

``` r
# Attach results to nl object:
setsim(nl, "simoutput") <- results

# Write output to outpath of experiment within nl
write_simoutput(nl)

# Do further analysis:
analyze_nl(nl)
```
